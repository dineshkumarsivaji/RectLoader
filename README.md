# RectLoader

Description:
This project will arrange the provided a bunch of rectangular pieces in a 
square surface so that they don't overlap, keeping the total area of the 
square as small as possible.

Deliverables:
AlgorithmDescription.txt  :  Contains problem description and algorithm description
RectLoader.cpp			  :  Contains common function used to place rectangles inside square layout  
RectLoader.h			  :  Project header file
TestAlgorithm.cpp 		  :	 Contains main function, used to test the RectLoader Algorithm
Input.txt				  :  Contains Input Rectangle dimensions
SampleOutput.jpg		  :  Contains sample output screen-shot

Execution:
Download the project from Github and build the VS project solution.
No external project dependencies.
Input file is already placed in project folder.
